In general, we aim to both have a practical impact by creating relevant and usable tools as well as by designing principled and fundamental approaches.\nThe group\u0026rsquo;s core areas are software engineering, computer systems, and programming languages. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\nSoftware reliability using techniques such as automated testing and program analysis Creating and improving essential systems such as compilers, programming language environments, and data processing systems Programming languages, in particular, their efficient implementation A current research focus is to improve the reliability of data-centric systems. To get a taste of the kind of research that falls under this term, have a look at the SQLancer project and Ternary Logic Partitioning paper. You can also consult my Google Scholar page for an up-to-date view of our research activities.\nAn ideal candidate has some of the following qualities:\nStrong implementation skills and a desire to create open-source tools The ability to come up with ideas and develop new approaches Not being afraid to tackle challenging, important problems The resilience to deal with fallbacks (which are quite common in research) and maintaining a work-life balance An interest in working on improving technical and non-technical skills A desire to write papers and publish at top venues (ICSE, ASPLOS, OOPSLA, \u0026hellip;) A motivation to share your work with the community (through presentations, talking to your peers, on your website, \u0026hellip;) An interest to learn about what other people are working on (e.g., by reading papers) It is not expected that you have all of these qualities; I am unsure whether I have all of them myself. However, keep in consideration that these qualities reflect ways in which you will likely be challenged and develop further if you decide to join the lab.\nIf you are interested in a position, feel free to reach out to me and send me your CV. If you are considering a PhD position, you can also directly apply here and mention my name in the application.

Deriving an efficient query plan is challenging, and both academia and industry have invested decades into researching query optimization. Despite this, DBMSs are prone to performance issues, where a DBMS produces an inefficient query plan that might lead to the slow execution of a query. Finding such issues is a longstanding problem and inherently difficult, because no ground truth information on an expected execution time exists. In this work, we propose Cardinality Estimation Restriction Testing (CERT), a novel technique that detects performance issues through the lens of cardinality estimation. Given a query on a database, CERT derives a more restrictive query (e.g., by replacing a LEFT JOIN with an INNER JOIN), whose estimated number of rows should not exceed the number of estimated rows for the original query. CERT tests cardinality estimators specifically, because they were shown to be the most important component for query optimization; thus, we expect that finding and fixing such issues might result in the highest performance gains. In addition, we found that some other kinds of query optimization issues are exposed by the unexpected cardinality estimation, which can also be detected by CERT. CERT is a black-box technique that does not require access to the source code; DBMSs expose query plans via the EXPLAIN statement. CERT eschews executing queries, which is costly and prone to performance fluctuations. We evaluated CERT on three widely used and mature DBMSs, MySQL, TiDB, and CockroachDB. CERT found 13 unique issues, of which 2 issues were fixed and 9 confirmed by the developers. We expect that this new angle on finding performance bugs will help DBMS developers in improving DMBSs' performance.","tags":null,"title":"Finding Performance Issues in Database Engines via Cardinality Estimation Testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"SQLancer automatically finds bugs in database systems.\n","date":1678466463,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678466463,"objectID":"33582b31a80d8bcf969c6da0910f0731","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/project/sqlancer/","publishdate":"2023-03-11T00:41:03+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/sqlancer/","section":"project","summary":"SQLancer automatically finds bugs in database systems.","tags":[],"title":"SQLancer","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677110400,"objectID":"b585acf372dbadd8873cf600ed78b7b0","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/23-02-23-distinguishedaward-icse23/","publishdate":"2023-02-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-02-23-distinguishedaward-icse23/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Our paper \"Testing Database Engines via Query Plan Guidance\" received \"ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award\" at ICSE'23!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672876800,"objectID":"3d5b9eaa0f8b340803c484e9a1c0ad81","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/23-01-05-researchaward-jinsheng/","publishdate":"2023-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-01-05-researchaward-jinsheng/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Jinsheng Ba received a \"Research Achievement Award\" from School of Computing!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670544000,"objectID":"6689cfd9f4ecef2ebf0beda866702603","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/22-12-09-qpg-icse23/","publishdate":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-12-09-qpg-icse23/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Our paper \"Testing Database Engines via Query Plan Guidance\" was accepted at ICSE'23!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jinsheng Ba","Manuel Rigger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670544000,"objectID":"ff85067ccb75b9add56fa65f371f35bb","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/publication/2023-icse-qpg/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-icse-qpg/","section":"publication","summary":"Database systems are widely used to store and query data. Test oracles have been proposed to find logic bugs in such systems, that is, bugs that cause the database system to compute an incorrect result. To realize a fully automated testing approach, such test oracles are paired with a test case generation technique; a test case refers to a database state and a query on which the test oracle can be applied. In this work, we propose the concept of Query Plan Guidance (QPG) for guiding automated testing towards \"interesting\" test cases. SQL and other query languages are declarative. Thus, to execute a query, the database system translates every operator in the source language to one of potentially many so-called physical operators that can be executed; the tree of physical operators is referred to as the query plan. Our intuition is that by steering testing towards exploring diverse query plans, we also explore more interesting behaviors—some of which are potentially incorrect. To this end, we propose a mutation technique that gradually applies promising mutations to the database state, causing the DBMS to create diverse query plans for subsequent queries. We applied our method to three mature, widely-used, and extensively-tested database systems—SQLite, TiDB, and CockroachDB—and found 53 unique, previously unknown bugs. Our method exercises 4.85—408.48× more unique query plans than a naive random generation method and 7.46× more than a code coverage guidance method. Since most database systems—including commercial ones—expose query plans to the user, we consider QPG a generally applicable, black-box approach and believe that the core idea could also be applied in other contexts (e.g., to measure the quality of a test suite).","tags":null,"title":"Testing Database Engines via Query Plan Guidance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matteo Kamm","Manuel Rigger","Chengyu Zhang","Zhendong Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670544000,"objectID":"c33260c2c9eac0e9ce2084d526f8229a","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/publication/2023-issta-gdbmeter/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-issta-gdbmeter/","section":"publication","summary":"Graph Database Management Systems (GDBMSs) store data as graphs and allow the efficient querying of nodes and their relationships. Logic bugs are bugs that cause a GDBMS to return an incorrect result for a given query (e.g., by returning incorrect nodes or relationships). The impact of such bugs can be severe, as they often go unnoticed. The core insight of this paper is that Query Partitioning, a test oracle that has been proposed to test Relational Database Systems, is applicable to testing GDBMSs as well. The core idea of Query Partitioning is that, given a query, multiple queries are derived whose results can be combined to reconstruct the given query’s result. Any discrepancy in the result indicates a logic bug. We have implemented this approach as a practical tool named GDBMeter and evaluated GDBMeter on three popular GDBMSs and found a total of 41 unique, previously unknown bugs. We consider 14 of them to be logic bugs, the others being error or crash bugs. Overall, 27 of the bugs have been fixed, and 35 confirmed. We compared our approach to the state-of-the-art approach to testing GDBMS, which relies on differential testing; we found that it results in a high number of false alarms, while Query Partitioning reported actual logic bugs without any false alarms. Furthermore, despite the previous efforts in testing Neo4j and JanusGraph, we found 13 additional bugs. The developers appreciate our work and plan to integrate GDBMeter into their testing process. We expect that this simple, yet effective approach and the practical tool will be used to test other GDBMSs.","tags":null,"title":"Testing Graph Database Engines via Query Partitioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"See https://nus-plse.github.io/seminars.html.\n","date":1664755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664755200,"objectID":"1ba9d4a71ddb9c74be3faf4d4f0b4915","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/22-10-03-chi-plse-talk/","publishdate":"2022-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-10-03-chi-plse-talk/","section":"post","summary":"See https://nus-plse.github.io/seminars.html.","tags":null,"title":"Chi will give a talk on \"Infrared: A Meta Bug Detector\" in the PLSE seminar this week.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Philippe Voinov","Manuel Rigger","Zhendong Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664755200,"objectID":"6dba1463fe05703a1705ea6cbda2523e","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/publication/2022-onward-forest/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-onward-forest/","section":"publication","summary":"Software developers frequently refactor code. Often, a single logical refactoring change involves changing multiple related components in a source base such as renaming each occurrence of a variable or function. While many code editors can perform such common and generic refactorings, they do not support more complex refactorings or those that are specific to a given code base. For those, as a flexible — albeit less interactive — alternative, developers can write refactoring scripts that can implement arbitrarily complex logic by manipulating the program's tree representation. In this work, we present Forest, a structural code editor that aims to bridge the gap between the interactiveness of code editors and the expressiveness of refactoring scripts. While structural editors have occupied a niche as general code editors, the key insight of this work is that they enable a novel structural multi-cursor design that allows Forest to reach a similar expressiveness as refactoring scripts; Forest allows to perform a single action simultaneously in multiple program locations and thus support complex refactorings. To support interactivity, Forest provides features typical for text code editors such as writing and displaying the program through its textual representation. Our evaluation demonstrates that Forest allows performing edits similar to those from refactoring scripts, while still being interactive. We attempted to perform edits from 48 real-world refactoring scripts using Forest and found that 11 were possible, while another 17 would be possible with added features. We believe that a multi-cursor setting plays to the strengths of structural editing, since it benefits from reliable and expressive. Our results suggest that multi-cursor structural editors could be practical for performing small-scale specialized refactorings.","tags":null,"title":"Forest: Structural Code Editing with Multiple Cursors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Rigger","Zhendong Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664755200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664755200,"objectID":"eca017828c70a5a478ad171c1351cdd5","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/publication/2022-onward-intramorphic/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-onward-intramorphic/","section":"publication","summary":"A test oracle determines whether a system behaves correctly for a given input.

To realize an Intramorphic Testing testing approach, a modified version of the system is created, for which, given a single input, a test oracle can be provided that relates the output of the original and modified systems. As a concrete example, by replacing a greater-equals operator in the implementation of a sorting algorithm with smaller-equals, it would be expected that the output of the modified implementation is the reverse output of the original implementation.
