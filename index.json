Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\nSoftware reliability using techniques such as automated testing and program analysis Creating and improving essential systems such as compilers, programming language environments, and data processing systems Programming languages, in particular, their efficient implementation A current research focus is to improve the reliability of data-centric systems. To get a taste of the kind of research that falls under this term, have a look at the SQLancer project and Ternary Logic Partitioning paper. You can also consult my Google Scholar page for an up-to-date view of our research activities.\nAn ideal candidate has some of the following qualities:\nStrong implementation skills and a desire to create open-source tools The ability to come up with ideas and develop new approaches Not being afraid to tackle challenging, important problems The resilience to deal with fallbacks (which are quite common in research) and maintaining a work-life balance An interest in working on improving technical and non-technical skills A desire to write papers and publish at top venues (ICSE, ASPLOS, OOPSLA, \u0026hellip;) A motivation to share your work with the community (through presentations, talking to your peers, on your website, \u0026hellip;) An interest to learn about what other people are working on (e.g., by reading papers) It is not expected that you have all of these qualities; I am unsure whether I have all of them myself. However, keep in consideration that these qualities reflect ways in which you will likely be challenged and develop further if you decide to join the lab.\nIf you are interested in a position, feel free to reach out to me and send me your CV.

Automatic testing techniques rely on an automated test oracle to test the system without user interaction. Important families of automated test oracles include Differential Testing and Metamorphic Testing, which are both black-box approaches; that is, they provide a test oracle that is oblivious to the system’s internals. In this work, we propose Intramorphic Testing, which is a new methodology to tackle the test oracle problem. To realize an Intramorphic Testing testing approach, a modified version of the system is created, for which, given a single input, a test oracle can be provided that relates the output of the original and modified systems. As a concrete example, by replacing a greater-equals operator in the implementation of a sorting algorithm with smaller-equals, it would be expected that the output of the modified implementation is the reverse output of the original implementation. In this paper, we introduce the methodology and illustrate it via a set of use cases.","tags":null,"title":"Intramorphic Testing: A New Approach to the Test Oracle Problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Manuel presented his experience interviewing for faculty positions at a seminar and panel discussion to PhD students and postdocs at the School of Computing at NUS.\n","date":1632700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632700800,"objectID":"9dcde8b3e167a16375cd25ad19dff2c4","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/post/21-09-27-nus-academic-job-experience-talk/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/21-09-27-nus-academic-job-experience-talk/","section":"post","summary":"Manuel presented his experience interviewing for faculty positions at a seminar and panel discussion to PhD students and postdocs at the School of Computing at NUS.","tags":null,"title":"Manuel shared his experience on the academic job market at a seminar and panel discussion at NUS","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://nus-test.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
