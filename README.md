# NUS Test Lab

## Bugs

Add any bugs that you have found as part of your research to be displayed at https://nus-test.github.io/bugs/.

They are stored in the `data/bugs.json` subdirectory. After adding the data (and installing the dependencies, see below), execute `make`:

```
pip3 install PyGithub beautifulsoup4
make
```

If you receive a "rate limit" error, you might need to use an [authenticated request](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api)  using a [GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens):

```
export GITHUB_LAB_TOKEN='enter your token here'
```
