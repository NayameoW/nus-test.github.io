summary: A lecture for CS3213 Foundations of Software Engineering
abstract: "Welcome to the rest of your life, budding software engineers. You think your job is just bringing a project from nothing to being fully featured, but what happens after release? See, after release, software continues to get updates, and continues to get features even as they receive bugfixes and overhauls. But compared to pre-release, velocity slows down tremendously as the number of stakeholders involved in the project increase hundredfold. This lecture will be about methods for mitigating the issues of software evolution."
